    "Q1. I chose a movie dataset that contains information about a large collection of films, including their titles, release years, genres, ratings, and other performance metrics. The dataset originally came from Kaggle, where it was compiled from public movie databases and user‑generated rating platforms. It includes features such as movie titles, release dates, IMDb ratings, vote counts, genres, and other descriptive attributes. I chose this dataset because I enjoy analyzing entertainment data, and movies provide a lot of interesting patterns to explore. The dataset also gives me the chance to practice filtering, grouping, and summarizing information using Pandas."
